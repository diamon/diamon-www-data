    desc: >
      The LTTng project aims at providing highly efficient tracing
      tools for Linux. Its tracers help tracking down performance
      issues and debugging problems involving multiple concurrent
      processes and threads.

    desc: >
      The Trace Compass project is an extensible trace viewer and
      analyzer. It reads and correlates CTF traces (including LTTng),
      as well as text logs.

    sub: What are mini core dumps?
    desc: >
      Core dumps can be too large for permanent storage on embedded
      systems. The goal of the mini core dump project is to provide
      a configurable excerpt of a full core dump. That allows space
      savings and eventually the storage of multiple dumps which
      enhances the debugability because it allows the observation
      of patterns.

    sub: Goal of the CTF specification
    desc: >
      The common trace format specifies a trace format based on the
      requirements of the industry (through collaboration with the
      Multicore Association) and the Linux community. We propose a
      subset of CTF for use with Linux as a reference. The format is
      flexible to address kernel, userspace and hardware tracing
      use-cases. The correlation of traces across multiples domains
      or multiple hosts is possible. By using a standard format, tools
      can be reused with traces providing from diverses sources.

    sub: What is Babeltrace?
    desc: >
      The Babeltrace project provides trace read and write libraries,
      as well as a trace converter. Plugins can be created for any trace
      format to allow its conversion to/from another trace format.
      The main format expected to be converted to/from is the Common
      Trace Format (CTF). The default input format of the “babeltrace”
      command is CTF, and its default output format is a human-readable
      text log. The “babeltrace-log” command converts from a text log to
      a CTF trace.

    desc: >
      Hardware vendors now provide hardware tracing mechanisms which are
      currently partially supported by the mainline Linux kernel.
      Reaching an agreement amongst vendors on a set of common
      interfaces would be a good step towards improving hardware
      tracing support under Linux.

      GDB supports saving tracing data in the Common Trace Format. By
      saving to a standard trace format, users are able to leverage
      existing tracing tools.

    desc: >
      The goal of this project is to add support to the Linux kernel to
      provide a correlated time between the kernel instrumentation and
      userspace in order to have a comprehensive kernel instrumentation
      coverage which can be correlated to user level traces. By
      providing a common clock, tools such as Perf, Ftrace, SystemTAP
      and LTTng can benefit from this enhancement.
